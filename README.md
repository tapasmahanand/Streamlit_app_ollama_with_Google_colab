# Streamlit_app_ollama_with_Google_colab
This project demonstrates how to deploy and interact with open-source Ollama models directly from Google Colab, while providing a Streamlit web interface for real-time user interaction. It is ideal for building and testing conversational LLM applications entirely in the cloud, without requiring any local installations.
